# Module 4: GLIE Monte Carlo

In this module, we will learn our first Reinforcement Learning algorithm. It's called GLIE (Greedy in the Limit of Infinite 
Exploration) Monte Carlo. 

## Lab

We will code up an agent that solves the CartPole-v0 environment using the GLIE Monte Carlo algorithm. While we are at it,
we will discuss best practices for organizing and writing code for Reinforcement Learning.

# Required reading

This section is for students who are financially disadvantaged and are not able to pay for the full course. You should still be able to learn a lot by going through the reading material listed below and solving the assignments.

The reading materials are a collection of free online resources that cover many of the things that I address in the course videos (though not everything unfortunately). It's best to go through them in the order listed. 

After you are done studying the listed materials, try solving the assignments.
