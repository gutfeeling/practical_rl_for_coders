# Required Reading for Module 1: Reinforcement Learning Breakthroughs and Use Cases

Students enrolled in the course have access to videos, screencasts and solutions to assignments. You do not need to go through 
the reading material, though it doesn't hurt if you are curious.

I understand that not all students are able to pay for the course. Therefore, I tried to make this public repository as self
contained as possible. If you are hard working and willing to devote time for self study, you should be able to complete this 
course by studying the following reading materials and then solving the open assignments. 

The reading materials are a collection of free online resources that cover many of the things that I address in the course 
videos (though not everything unfortunately). Please go through them in the order listed. 

To test whether you have learned anything, try solving the assignments. If you can solve the assignments without problems, 
you have picked up the required knowledge for this module.
