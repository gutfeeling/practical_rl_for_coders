# Module 1: Reinforcement Learning Breakthroughs and Use Cases

In the first module of this course, I want to get you excited about Reinforcement Learning. In the last 5 years, we have witnessed
multiple breakthroughs in AI coming from research on Reinforcement Learning. We will go through some of these breakthroughs in 
layman's terms and try to understand why they are so remarkable and exciting. 

We will also take a look at how some of these breakthroughs are being commercialized in the industry, creating demand for 
Reinforcement Learning engineers.

# Required reading

Students enrolled in the course have access to lecture videos, coding screencasts and assignment solutions. You **do not** need to 
go through the reading material listed here, though it doesn't hurt if you are curious.

This section is for students who are financially disadvantaged and are not able to pay for the course. The reading materials are a 
collection of free online resources that cover many of the things that I address in the course videos (though not everything 
unfortunately). It's best to go through them in the order listed. 

After you are done studying the listed materials, try solving the assignments. If you can solve the assignments without problems, 
you have picked up the required knowledge for this module.

# Assignments

This module is reading only. There are no assignments. The goal is to get you excited about Reinforcement Learning. So if you 
feel excited already, then you can go onto [Module 2: Reinforcement Learning Basics with OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/gutfeeling/practical_rl_for_coders/tree/master/02_rl_basics_with_openai_gym).
