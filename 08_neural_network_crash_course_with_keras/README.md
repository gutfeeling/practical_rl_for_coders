# Module 8: Neural Network Crash Course With `Keras`

At the end of this module

1. You will be able to explain how Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) work
2. You will be able to define activation, loss and backprogragation in the context of Neural Networks
3. You will be able to install `Keras`
4. You will be able to create MLP and CNN models in `Keras`, add different types of activations to layers, 
use different types of loss functions and optimizers, and even write your own custom loss functions
5. You will be able to distinguish between batch and minibatch gradient descent and implement both in `Keras`
6. You will be able to automatically generate logs using `Keras`
7. You will implement a MLP in `Keras` that learns to sum the squares of a set of numbers :tada:
