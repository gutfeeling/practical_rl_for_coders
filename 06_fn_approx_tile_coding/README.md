# Module 4: Function Approximation (Tile Coding)

In this module, we will introduce environments that are difficult to solve using tabular methods. To solve these environments, 
we will learn a technique called function approximation. In particular, we will explore linear function approximators and 
discuss a particular variation called Tile Coding.

## Lab

We will code up an agent that solves the MountainCar-v0 environment using function approximation and Tile Coding using Richard 
Sutton's Python package.

# Required reading

This section is for students who are financially disadvantaged and are not able to pay for the full course. You should still be able to learn a lot by going through the reading material listed below and solving the assignments.

The reading materials are a collection of free online resources that cover many of the things that I address in the course videos (though not everything unfortunately). It's best to go through them in the order listed. 

After you are done studying the listed materials, try solving the assignments.
