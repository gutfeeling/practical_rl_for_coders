# Module 2: Reinforcement Learning Basics with OpenAI Gym

In this module, we will learn about the basic building blocks of Reinforcement Learning. We will use the Python package 
OpenAI Gym to get a practical feeling for all components of a Reinforcement Learning problem - the Agent, the Environment, 
Actions and Rewards. We will talk about the learning goal of Reinforcement Learning and how to define it in terms of maximizing 
the discounted reward sum. 

We will code up an agent that takes random actions in the CartPole-v0 environment and talk about the importance of a random 
baseline. OpenAI Gym specfic techniques such Environment Wrapping and Monitoring will also be covered, so that you can 
modify environments to your liking and capture data/videos automatically.

# Required reading

Students enrolled in the course have access to lecture videos, coding screencasts and assignment solutions. You **do not** need to 
go through the reading material listed here, though it doesn't hurt if you are curious.

This section is for students who are financially disadvantaged and are not able to pay for the course. You should still be able 
to learn a lot by going through the reading material listed below and solving the assignments.

The reading materials are a collection of free online resources that cover many of the things that I address in the course videos (though not everything 
unfortunately). It's best to go through them in the order listed. 

After you are done studying the listed materials, try solving the assignments.
