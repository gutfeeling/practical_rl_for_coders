# Module 9: Function Approximation (Neural Network)

At the end of this module

1. You will implement your first Deep RL algorithm (Deep SARSA) to solve the `CartPole-v0` environment :tada:
2. You will be able to list the difficulties associated with using Neural Networks successfully in RL

## Plan

1. :movie_camera: Neural Networks as function approximators
2. :pencil: **Exercise**: *Modify `ModelAndPolicy` for `CartPole-v0` to use a `Keras` model for function approximation.*
3. :pencil: **Exercise**: *Modify the update rule in `ModelAndPolicy` to implement `Keras model` fitting based on
SARSA(0).*
4. :movie_camera: Theoretical limits on convergence for Neural Networks as function approximators
