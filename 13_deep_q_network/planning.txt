env_wrappers

1. Should take concatenated frames as parameters (cf)
2. reset should take cf -1 actions. this way we have cf frames for the first
   observation.
3. the last cf frames should be saved in a deque like object of size cf.
4. step should implement frame skip (fs).
5. step should add up the rewards in the skipped frames.
6. step should also save the max of fs-1^th and fs^th observation to the deque
   like object.
7. step should resize and grayscale observations
8. step should limit the action space as we did for Pong.
9. step should return a lazy object which concatenates the frames only when
   np.array() is called.
